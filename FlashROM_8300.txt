Notes for FlashROM_8300

---

R3:

Usually do not install R3.

R3 just allows the board to support older flash, eeprom, and even UV/OTP eprom devices that have a Vpp pin, and where the Vpp pin should be tied to Vcc when not programming. Even some of the older devices with Vpp don't need this.

You can't buy those devices new today anyway. The support is only there because "why not?", the pinouts are all the same except for the single extra Vpp pin, so it costs nothing to allow the board to support a wide range of devices.

---

SUPPORTED CHIPS:

Any jedec pinout, 5v, 128k x 8, parallel device.

Without R3 installed, supports single-voltage devices (no Vpp pin), and some older devices with a Vpp pin that don't need it tied to Vcc or gnd when not programming. At least:  
39SF010, 29SF010, 29EE010, NM27C010

With R3 installed, supports all of the above, plus older devices that have a Vpp pin. At least:  
28F010, 28C010, 27SF010, 27C010

In all cases above, both the TSOP and PLCC (or CLCC!) package are supported.

PROGRAMMING:

In all cases, when programming, tell the programmer software that you have the PLCC version of whatever chip is installed. Even if the chip on the board is TSOP, the pinout presented on the DIP legs is the PLCC pinout.

Most device families are interchangeable between manufacturers, so if a device is compatible but your programmer doesn't list it explicitly, you can usually just tell the programmer that you have the same device from a manufacturer it does list.

You do have to match the family, just not the manufacturer (usually). If you have a 29EE010, don't tell the programmer you have a 29SF010.

For instance, if you have a GLS29EE010 TSOP soldered on the board:
The TL-866 minipro utility does not list "GLS29EE010" but it does list "SST29EE010".
Always say PLCC.

So tell minipro you have a "SST29EE010@PLCC32" device.

This example run was with a GLS29EE010 TSOP soldered on the board:

$ minipro -y -p "SST29EE010@PLCC32" -w 831000-438-y2k.bin 
Found TL866II+ 04.2.110 (0x26e)

This example run was with a SST39SF010A PLCC32 installed:

$ minipro -p "SST39SF010A@PLCC32" -w 831000-438-y2k.bin
